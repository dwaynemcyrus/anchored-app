# Known limitations

- iOS: When the Quick Capture modal opens and the keyboard appears, the browser may shift the viewport. This is an iOS visual viewport behavior and not fully preventable with CSS or scroll locking.
- The long-press drag-to-navigate mode has no tap-based fallback menu in v1.
- Editor: The typewriter scroll offset is fixed in v1 (no user-facing control yet).
